# SoundDrizzle

This is nothing more than a simple downloader for SoundCloud so that you can listen to your favorite tracks offline.

**It is your responsibility to check whether or not the track has rights reserved, and if you're allowed to download**

You can use the script against SoundCloud URLs...

```bash
$ drizzle https://soundcloud.com/ovey/duck-sauce-barba-streisand-ovey-remix-clip
```

or perform a search on the API:

```bash
$ drizzle "Archie V - Rainbow'n'Dash"
```
